# YouTube Educators Social Network Analytics (SNA) Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end **Social Network Analytics (SNA)** and visualization tool built using Python and Streamlit. It analyzes **YouTube educators** and their ecosystem based on video data, viewer engagement, and network structures.


## What is Social Network Analytics?

**Social Network Analytics (SNA)** is a field of data analysis that examines the structure and dynamics of relationships among entities (like people, organizations, or content creators). In this project, we analyze:

- **Collaboration patterns** among YouTube educators
- **Viewer engagement and overlaps**
- **Community formation and influence**
- **Content trends and growth predictions**


## Project Objectives

1. Identify influential YouTube educator channels based on network metrics and user engagement.
2. Analyze collaboration and content overlap between channels.
3. Predict future trends in views and engagement using time-series forecasting.
4. Present all findings through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.
